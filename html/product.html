                        it can only function in conjunction with additional components. The silicon 
                        chip is inserted into a specific socket on the device's main circuit board 
                        (motherboard or mainboard). It is distinct from the memory, which serves as a 
                        temporary storage location for data.

                        A GPU also known as graphics processing unit is a computer processor that performs fast 
                        mathematical calculations to render visuals and images. Professional and home 
                        computing both benefit from GPUs. GPUs are typically used to render 2D and 3D graphics, 
                        animations, and video, though they increasingly have a broader range of applications.

                    <p>The power supply is the backbone of all PCs. These devices draw power from 
                        wall outlets and distribute power through the PC. Without the right amount 
                        of power, the device will not work the way it needs to. Also, the power may 
                        not  turn on. In addition to supplying power, power supplies can also provide 
                        false current failover protection and protect components in the event of a PC crash.
